# AI_Research_Project
Final research project for AI course.

This project applies machine learning regression techniques to predict bike rental demand using the Bike Sharing dataset. The process includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation using PyCaret's automated machine learning environment. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated, and the best-performing model identified was CatBoost Regressor based on the comparison metrics. The final model demonstrated strong predictive performance, indicating that machine learning can effectively estimate rental counts based on environmental and seasonal features.
